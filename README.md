# Drone Detection with YOLOv5 and GUI Application

Welcome to our project where we use YOLOv5 to detect drones in images and videos, and also provide a GUI application to make it more accessible for everyone.

## Installation

To use our drone detection app, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
  `git clone https://github.com/your_username/drone-detection.git` 

2.  Install the required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

3.  Download the `Drone_Detection.pt` model file from the [release](https://github.com/kuldeepaher01/Drone-Detection-Using-Yolov5/blob/main/Drone_Detection.pt) page.

## Usage

 1. To run the drone detection model in the Jupyter notebook, open
    `Drone_detection.ipynb` and run the cells.
    
 2.   To run the GUI application, run `GUI_application.py` using the
    following command: `python GUI_application.py`
    
 3. The application window will appear where you can select an image or
    video file to detect drones in. The output will be shown on the
    screen. (You may need to change path of pytorch model in
    GUI_application.py)
 4. We also have dataset hosted on here.
